## Problem 1: Java Abstract Class

This is a problem about Java abstract classes from **Hackerrank**.

### Problem Statement

CONCEPT: A Java abstract class cannot be instantiated and serves as a base for subclasses. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared without implementation and are defined using the `abstract` keyword.

Create a class `MyBook` that extends the abstract class `Book`. Implement the `setTitle` method in `MyBook` to set the title of the book.

### Solution

We are provided with the abstract `Book` class and a `Main` class in the editor. In the `Main` class, we created an instance of a class called `MyBook`.

1. Create a class `MyBook` that extends `Book`.
2. Implement the `setTitle` method in `MyBook` to set the `title` attribute.
3. Use `MyBook` in the `Main` class to verify the implementation.

This problem helps understand the use of abstract classes and method implementation in Java.
