# Day 1 
## Problem 1:
Inheritance I This is an Inheritance problem from **Hackerrank**. 
### Problem Statement
Add a `sing` method to the Bird class, then modify the main method accordingly so that the code prints the following lines: 
      I am walking 
      I am flying 
      I am singing 
      
### Solution 
The problem provides us with a base class `Animal` and a derived class `Bird` with methods `walk` and `fly` respectively. The objective is to add a new method `sing` in class `Bird` to print the above lines as output. 
This is a basic problem to understand the concept of inheritance and how to call methods through a class object.

## Problem 2:
Inheritance II This is another inheritance problem on **Hackerrank**. 
### Problem Statement
Add the following to the editor code where indicated:
      1. A class named `Arithmetic` with a method named `add` that takes integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum. 
      2. A class named `Adder` that inherits from a superclass named `Arithmetic`. 
    
### Solution 
We have added class Adder Inheriting class Arithmetic. So, we can call method of class Arithmetic with object of class Adder.
This problem helps us understand that even if we do not have any methods in the derived class, we can still use the methods of the base class with the object of the child class.
